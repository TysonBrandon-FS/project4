# Travel Price Tracker - Branding

## Fonts
I'm using:
- **Roboto** for body text - clean and easy to read
- **Montserrat** for headings - adds some personality

I picked these because they're simple, modern, and work well for showing data like prices and dates.

## Colors
- **Blue** (#3498DB) - for buttons and main actions
- **Grey** (#7F8C8D) - for text and backgrounds
- **Blueish grey** (#95A5A6) - for secondary elements
- **White** (#FFFFFF) - for card backgrounds
- **Black** (#000000) - for main text
- **Red** (#E74C3C) - accent color for important alerts or errors

I chose these colors because they're clean and professional. The blue and grey give it a modern look, and red will stand out when I need to grab attention.

## Icons
I'm using line icons (like Feather Icons) because they're clean and simple. I'll use:
- Map pin for destinations
- Calendar for dates
- Dollar sign for money/budget
- Chart for price history
- Bell for alerts

All icons will use the same style so they look consistent.

## Graphics/Photos/Textures
I'm keeping it simple:
- No busy photos or textures
- Let the data be the main focus
- Use simple backgrounds (white or light gray)
- Charts will show price history over time

The app is about tracking prices, so I don't want anything distracting from the important information.
