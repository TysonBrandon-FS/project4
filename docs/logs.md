## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week
<br>
🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

### Week 1

## ⚙️ Overview

Good week! I got to reveiew all my workf rom the previous class and review some items I definitly could brush up on in regaurds to back end programming.

## 🌵 Challenges

Working on different branches has always been confusing for me. this week I have made main, and staging, and dev, but im also supposed to work on feature branches inside of dev? That is always a bit confusing for me.

## 🏆 Accomplishments

I feel great after reviewing express and server and route connections. Like I said previously, backend is not my favorite but reviewing express has ben benifitial

Next steps are to redo annd up my figma framework. I have a nice design but could definitly be cleaned up.
