## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week
<br>
🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>

### Week 1

## ⚙️ Overview

Good week! I got to reveiew all my workf rom the previous class and review some items I definitly could brush up on in regaurds to back end programming.

## 🌵 Challenges

Working on different branches has always been confusing for me. this week I have made main, and staging, and dev, but im also supposed to work on feature branches inside of dev? That is always a bit confusing for me.

## 🏆 Accomplishments

I feel great after reviewing express and server and route connections. Like I said previously, backend is not my favorite but reviewing express has ben benifitial 

## 🔮 Next Steps

Next steps are to redo annd up my figma framework. I have a nice design but could definitly be cleaned up.



### Week 2

## ⚙️ Overview

This week I focused on building my style-tile for my project in Figma. I worked on creating and organizing the styles, like colors, fonts, and overall design choices. I also edited and improved my Figma document to make it more clear and organized. Also I did study more about feature branches in GitHub so I can manage everything better.

## 🌵 Challenges

One challenge I am still having is adding dates to my roadmap project board. The dates are not displaying properly, and I have tried to fix it but it is still not working how it should, I am clearly doing something wrong. Need to look into this more, so the roadmap can display correctly.

## 🏆 Accomplishments

I successfully built out my style-tile and made improvements to my Figma document. I also learned more about feature branches in GitHub, which me merge everything successful after a bunch of failed pulls and pushs in github. git fetch origin dev, was the key to updating the files in cursor.


## 🔮 Next Steps

Next week I plan to continue editing and building out my Figma document. I also want to keep improving my roadmap board and figure out how to fix the date issue so everything displays correctly.
