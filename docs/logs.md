## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week
<br>
🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>

### Week 1

## ⚙️ Overview
This week I set up my GitHub repo, created the main branches, and opened my milestone pull request. I started writing my research notes about flight and hotel APIs and planned out how the app will track price changes. I also created issues and organized my project board so everything is easier to follow.

## 🌵 Challenges
The hardest part was understanding the GitHub workflow with dev, staging, and feature branches. It was also a little confusing picking which APIs were actually good for price tracking because a lot of them either cost money or don’t wanna give full access. Figuring out how the app should check prices on a timer also took some thinking.

## 🏆 Accomplishments
I got much better at using feature branches, making pull requests, and merging them the right way. I also learned how flight and hotel APIs work and which ones are realistic for this project. I feel more confident organizing my tasks with issues and a project board.

## 🔮 Next Steps
Next week I plan to start wireframes, begin early UI layout in React, and set up the backend routes in Express. I also want to write more documentation and start testing the Amadeus API to make sure I can actually pull live prices.


### Week 2

## ⚙️ Overview
This week I worked on wireframing my app and figuring out the branding. I sketched out the main pages like the dashboard, trip details, and forms. I also decided on fonts, colors, and icons for the app.

## 🌵 Challenges
- Figuring out which pages I actually need
- Picking colors that make sense
- Making wireframes that show how the app works

## 🏆 Accomplishments
- Made wireframes for all the main pages
- Picked fonts (Inter/Roboto and Montserrat/Poppins)
- Chose a color scheme (blue, green, orange, red, gray)
- Decided on using line icons
- Updated my research doc with wireframing and branding info

## 🔮 Next Steps
Next week I want to start building the actual app in React and set up the backend. I'll use the wireframes and branding I created this week as a guide.


### Week 3

## ⚙️ Overview
-Figma, Figma Figma! I am working on building out my wireframes. Trying to  play catch up a little bit with this crazy schudle I have.

## 🌵 Challenges
-The biggest challenge this week was my work schedule, like I said above, which limites my design.Going back and readin notes the professor left from last week has me beginning to break my tasks into smaller task.

## 🏆 Accomplishments
-fixing my github up a little bit. Wrking and pushing to the correct branch, making smaller task to be more manageable pieces and tracking them better using GitHub. So I feel like I leveled up my project organization. I finished edit my main page and did lots of good work on the sign up / sign in page

## 🔮 Next Steps
-My next priority is to finish the Figma UI by completing the other screens liek signup or login, and then tightening the overall user flow. 

### Week 4

My final stand up...
