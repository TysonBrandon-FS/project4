## Week1 Research

This week I research Express to review it since it’s been a while, and I mainly went over how to connect Express to a server and get everything running again. I also reviewed how middleware works and how it fits into handling requests and responses. Going back over this reminded me why I choose Express to make things simpler, because I don’t really like backend programming that much. It’s nice that Express keeps things simple and doesn’t feel overly complicated when you just need something to work.
