## Week2 Research

I did some research on better GitHub practices hoping I start staying organized on GitHub. INaming branches correctly can help keep everything neat and easier to understand later. I also learned more about how branches work, because I know how they work basically, but when we get into working on different brnahces besides main, and the the sub branches that need to be merged into other brnach, it is a little confusing.. It took me a while to pull the changes from my dev branch after I pushed and merged my feature branch called style-tile, but after doing this research I understand better how branches connect and th egit command to fetch and pull updates.
