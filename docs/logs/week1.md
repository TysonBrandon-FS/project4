# Week 1 Log – Travel Price Tracker

## ⚙️ Overview
This week I set up my GitHub repo, created the main branches, and opened my milestone pull request. I started writing my research notes about flight and hotel APIs and planned out how the app will track price changes. I also created issues and organized my project board so everything is easier to follow.

## 🌵 Challenges
The hardest part was understanding the GitHub workflow with dev, staging, and feature branches. It was also a little confusing picking which APIs were actually good for price tracking because a lot of them either cost money or don’t wanna give full access. Figuring out how the app should check prices on a timer also took some thinking.

## 🏆 Accomplishments
I got much better at using feature branches, making pull requests, and merging them the right way. I also learned how flight and hotel APIs work and which ones are realistic for this project. I feel more confident organizing my tasks with issues and a project board.

## 🔮 Next Steps
Next week I plan to start wireframes, begin early UI layout in React, and set up the backend routes in Express. I also want to write more documentation and start testing the Amadeus API to make sure I can actually pull live prices.
