## Week 2 – Wireframing & Branding

### ⚙️ Overview
This week I worked on wireframing my app and figuring out the branding. I sketched out the main pages like the dashboard, trip details, and forms. I also decided on fonts, colors, and icons for the app.

### 🌵 Challenges
- Figuring out which pages I actually need
- Picking colors that make sense
- Making wireframes that show how the app works

### 🏆 Accomplishments
- Made wireframes for all the main pages
- Picked fonts (Inter/Roboto and Montserrat/Poppins)
- Chose a color scheme (blue, green, orange, red, gray)
- Decided on using line icons
- Updated my research doc with wireframing and branding info

### 🔮 Next Steps
Next week I want to start building the actual app in React and set up the backend. I'll use the wireframes and branding I created this week as a guide.
